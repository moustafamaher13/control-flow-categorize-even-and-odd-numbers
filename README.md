# Control Flow Categorize Even and Odd Numbers
1- Define a list of numbers to perform categorizing on
2- Define two empty lists, one for even numbers and one for odd numbers
3- Start a for loop through all the numbers in the numbers list
4- For each number in the numbers list, perform a switch case on the number modulo 2
5- if the remainder of the divison equals 0, then the number is even and is added to the even numbers list
6- otherwise, the number is odd and is added to the odd numbers list
7- after the for loop, print the even and odd numbers' lists seperately
